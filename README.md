# :rocket: upwork-wlroots-bridge :rocket:

Rust Implementation for Wlroots (Sway, Wayfire, Hikari, River, etc.) of Gnome
Screenshot and Idle DBUS Server (with extra features), which Upwork uses to capture the screen as
proof of work.

This work was inspired on the python implementation of the Gnome Screenshot DBUS
Server made by MarSoft which can be found [here](https://github.com/MarSoft/upwork-wayland).
